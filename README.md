# Generation-Reveal
This is a web app that shows you which generation you actually belong to.
It's not really import to know but it's an interesting app if you ask me.

Generations were sourced from https://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/06/us/baby-boomer-generation-fast-facts/index.html
And also https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/%3famp=1
